        I recently moved to the Raleigh-Durham area to pursue a career change because of the opportunities the area has to offer in the field of Web Development. While I may be new to the professional industry I have a long history of using the analytical way of thinking that development requires in my personal life.

        I have always enjoyed working with technology and began coding when I got my first Lego Mindstorm at the age of eight. That passion has stuck with me ever since. In high school I was on a robotics team that won regional - and competed in national  - competitions for all four years and was the captain for the last three.
        
        I'm an avid reader, mostly of fiction, although I have started to transition to reading primarily nonfiction books. Most recently I've been reading American history (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19436633-fred-erickson">click here to check out my Goodreads profile to see what I'm currently reading</a>). Aside from reading I'm also a big fan of camping, tennis, and skiing.
        
        If my experience and background interests you please contact me here, on my LinkedIn, or via e-mail! I'm open to remote and in office opportunities.
